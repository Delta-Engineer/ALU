# ALU
How to create a basic ALU using VHDL, project is executed on FPGA (ALTERA DE2-115) 

# Getting Started
The code can be reused no matter what FPGA you are programming, just make sure that if you are exporting the entire project that you change the port destinations if you are not using the same development board. 

# Exporting project
If you have the IDE setup, either export the entire github project and use it on the IDE, or create your own project folder and use the ALU.vhd. 

# Built With
Quartus II - The IDE used ; ALTERA DE2-115 - The FPGA dev board used

# Versioning
Version 1.0

# Authors
Harmon Singh - Initial work See also the list of contributors who participated in this project.

# Acknowledgments
Hat tip to anyone who uses the code =) or have any comments =)... Inspiration etc
